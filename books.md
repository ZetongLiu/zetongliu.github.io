 This is a list of books I've read so far, and the genres is heavily skewed by my eurocentric novel obessession during my college years in China. Inspired by Patrick Collison, I mark exceptional ones I regard as in green and above average ones in blue.
 - *The Prince* - Niccolo Machiavelli
 - Baudolino, Umberto Eco
